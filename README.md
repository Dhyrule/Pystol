# Pystol
Collection of network management tools written in Python

Deliberately written for a pure cisco environment, but enxtensible to multi-vendor in the future


A fellow on reddit (/u/jdub01010101) alerted me to the fact that there was no license file, so I added one.  

There is no disclaimer on each source file.  I will probably add one, but until then I'll be relying on internet fairies to stop you from hurting yourself with this code.

This code depends entirely upon Paramiko.  Available at http://www.paramiko.org/.
Paramiko itself depends on a few other packages.  All of these are available through PyPy and other python package distribution schemes. 

This is developed for and is known to run on Linux with Python 2.6.
